# Firebase Authentication Integration

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your SoftGenAI app now uses **Firebase Authentication** and **Firestore** to store and manage user data instead of the previous in-memory/backend storage.

---

## 🔥 Firebase Services Used

### 1. **Firebase Authentication**
- Handles user sign-up and sign-in
- Supports email/password authentication
- Supports Google OAuth authentication
- Generates secure Firebase ID tokens

### 2. **Firestore Database**
- Stores user profiles in the `users` collection
- Each user document contains:
  - `uid` - Firebase user ID
  - `username` - User's chosen username
  - `email` - User's email address
  - `picture` - Profile picture URL (for Google users)
  - `createdAt` - Account creation timestamp
  - `provider` - Authentication method ("email" or "google")

---

## 📋 How It Works

### **Sign Up Flow** (`/signup`)
1. User enters username, email, and password
2. Firebase creates the user account with `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()`
3. Username is added to the user profile with `updateProfile()`
4. User data is stored in Firestore at `users/{uid}`
5. Firebase ID token is generated and stored in localStorage
6. User is redirected to `/home`

### **Sign In Flow** (`/signin`)
1. User enters username and password
2. App queries Firestore to find user by username
3. Once found, retrieves the user's email
4. Uses email + password to authenticate with Firebase
5. Firebase ID token is stored in localStorage
6. User is redirected to `/home`

**Note**: Firebase requires email for authentication, so we use Firestore to map username → email

### **Google Sign In Flow** (`/login`)
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth returns a credential token
3. Token is used to sign in to Firebase with `signInWithCredential()`
4. App checks if user exists in Firestore
5. If new user, creates document in `users` collection
6. If existing user, retrieves their username from Firestore
7. Firebase ID token is stored in localStorage
8. User is redirected to `/home`

## 🗂️ Firestore Data Structure

```
users (collection)
  └── {uid} (document)
      ├── uid: string
      ├── username: string
      ├── email: string
      ├── picture: string (optional)
      ├── createdAt: ISO timestamp
      └── provider: "email" | "google"
```

## 📁 Updated Files

### Frontend Files Modified:

1. **`client/src/firebase.js`**
   - Initialized Firebase Auth and Firestore
   - Exported `auth` and `db` instances

2. **`client/src/routes/SignUp.jsx`**
   - Uses `createUserWithEmailAndPassword()` from Firebase Auth
   - Stores user data in Firestore with `setDoc()`
   - Saves Firebase ID token to localStorage

3. **`client/src/routes/SignIn.jsx`**
   - Queries Firestore to find user by username
   - Uses `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` with retrieved email
   - Handles Firebase-specific error codes

4. **`client/src/components/GoogleLoginButton.jsx`**
   - Uses `signInWithCredential()` for Google OAuth
   - Creates or updates user document in Firestore
   - Stores Firebase ID token

## 🔐 Security Features

### **Firebase Authentication Provides:**
- ✅ Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- ✅ Email verification (can be enabled)
- ✅ Rate limiting on login attempts
- ✅ Token expiration and refresh
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication (can be added)

### **Firestore Security Rules (Recommended)**

Add these rules in Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read their own document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow reading user documents by username for login
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. **Email Verification**
```javascript
import { sendEmailVerification } from "firebase/auth";

// After signup
await sendEmailVerification(user);
```

### 2. **Password Reset**
```javascript
import { sendPasswordResetEmail } from "firebase/auth";

await sendPasswordResetEmail(auth, email);
```

### 3. **Profile Updates**
```javascript
import { updateProfile } from "firebase/auth";
import { updateDoc, doc } from "firebase/firestore";

// Update Firebase Auth profile
await updateProfile(auth.currentUser, {
  displayName: newUsername,
  photoURL: newPhotoURL
});

// Update Firestore document
await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid), {
  username: newUsername,
  picture: newPhotoURL
});
```

### 4. **Auth State Persistence**
Add to `App.jsx`:
```javascript
import { onAuthStateChanged } from "firebase/auth";
import { auth } from "./firebase";

useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
    if (user) {
      // User is signed in
      console.log("User is logged in:", user);
    } else {
      // User is signed out
      console.log("User is logged out");
    }
  });
  
  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Firebase: Error (auth/popup-blocked)"**
- Google sign-in popup was blocked by browser
- Solution: Allow popups for localhost in browser settings

### **Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions"**
- Firestore security rules are too restrictive
- Solution: Update rules in Firebase Console

### **Issue: "Firebase: Error (auth/email-already-in-use)"**
- Email is already registered
- Solution: User should sign in instead of signing up

### **Issue: Username not found during login**
- Username doesn't exist in Firestore
- Solution: User needs to sign up first

**https://console.firebase.google.com/project/softgenai-fc813**

### Key Sections:
- **Authentication** → View registered users
- **Firestore Database** → View user documents
- **Usage** → Monitor API calls and storage

## ✅ Benefits of Firebase

1. **No Backend Needed** - Firebase handles auth and database
2. **Scalable** - Automatically scales with your user base
3. **Secure** - Industry-standard security practices
4. **Real-time** - Can add real-time features easily
5. **Free Tier** - Generous free tier for development

## 🎯 Current Authentication Flow Summary

```
Sign Up:
User Input → Firebase Auth (create account) → Firestore (store profile) → localStorage → /home

Sign In:
Username → Firestore (find email) → Firebase Auth (verify) → localStorage → /home

Google Sign In:
Google OAuth → Firebase Auth (sign in) → Firestore (create/update profile) → localStorage → /home
```

**Your authentication is now fully integrated with Firebase!** 🎉

All user data (username, email, profile) is securely stored in Firebase, and you no longer need the Node.js backend for authentication.
